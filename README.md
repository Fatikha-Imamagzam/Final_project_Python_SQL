Task 1. A/B testing
1.1 Condition

One of the main tasks of the analyst in our team is the correct conduct of experiments. To do this, we use the A/B testing method. During testing of one hypothesis, the target group was offered a new mechanism for paying for services on the site, while the control group retained the basic mechanics. As a task, you need to analyze the results of the experiment and decide whether it is worth launching a new payment mechanism for all users.

1.2 Input

You have 4 csv files as input:

groups.csv - file with information about the user's belonging to the control or experimental group (A - control, B - target group)
groups_add.csv - an additional file with users that was sent to you 2 days after the data transfer
active_studs.csv - a file with information about users who logged into the platform on the days of the experiment.
checks.csv - a file with information about user payments on the days of the experiment.
1.3 Questions

We invite you to answer the following questions:

What metrics do you look at during the analysis and why?
Are there differences in performance and what might they be related to?
Are these differences statistically significant?
Is it worth launching new mechanics for all users?
This list of questions is optional, and you can base your answer on your own plan.
